### Uncertainties of the solar axion flux

In &ldquo;Quantifying uncertainties in the solar axion flux and their impact on determining axion model parameters.&rdquo; we study uncertainties associated with axion-photon and axion-electron interactions.

The plot above shows the solar axion fluxes from ABC, longitudinal plasmon&nbsp;(LP), Primakoff&nbsp;(P), and transverse plasmon&nbsp;(TP) interactions as a function of energy, using Opacity Project data and the various solar models available in the code.

We used Monte Carlo&nbsp;(MC) simulation to calculate the flux for two representative solar models; the AGSS09 and GS98 models as representative choices for photospheric and helioseismological solar models, respectively. The plot above shows the (normalised) mean values and standard deviations for ABC&nbsp;(right) and Primakoff&nbsp;(P; left) interactions. The grey bands illustrate the MC noise from 100 randomly chosen MC spectra.

Calculations of the axion flux from nuclear transitions were added later.

### Axions as solar thermometers

We then studied how to infer the solar temperature (and Debye screening scale) at different locations inside the Sun by inverting the helioscope &ldquo;axion image.&rdquo;
The folder [python/](python/) contains the Python scripts.


## Installation

### Requirements
The code is written in C++ (your compiler must support the C++11 standard) and requires the GSL library v2.3 (or higher).
Optionally, if you want to build Python wrappers with pybind11 (v2.10.4 will be automatically downloaded), you also need Python v3.9 (or higher) and cython.


### Steps
To install and test the code, follow these steps:

1. If necessary: install CMAKE v3.12 (or higher).
   - On Mac OS: use e.g. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install CMAKE via `brew install cmake`.
2. Install the GSL library.
   - On Mac OS: use e.g. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the GSL library via `brew install gsl`.
   - On Linux: use `sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev` instead.
   - If you don't have admin privileges on either operating system, you need to [install the GSL library from source](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).
3. Clone this repo via `git clone https://github.com/sebhoof/SolarAxionFlux [foldername]`, where `[foldername]` can be replaced by a folder name of your choice.
4. Use the latest `master` branch (no need to do anything) or checkout a tagged version as a new branch (e.g. `git checkout v0.8b -b [some_branch_name]`).
5. Set up a directory via `cd [foldername]`, `mkdir build`, and `cd build/`.
6. In most cases `cmake ..` and then `make` should build everything. If this fails, consult the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

To validate your installation, you may use the `test_library` executable in the `bin/` folder to run a simple test program.
If you installed the Python frontend, you can also run this test from a Python terminal or notebook via `from lib import pyaxionflux as afl` (assuming you are in `[foldername]` or added `[foldername]` to your `PYTHONPATH` variable) and `afl.test_module()`. In either case, the output can be found in the `[foldername]/results/` folder.

## Get stared
We include the simple Jupyter notebook [examples.ipynb](examples.ipynb), which demonstrates a few of the capabilities available through the Python frontend (needs to be installed).

Alternatively, the `test_library` executable in the `bin/` directory runs a simple test program.

## How to cite

**All references mentioned below are can be found in the [references.bib](references.bib) file.**
You may also consider using the [BibCom tool](https://github.com/sebhoof/bibcom) to generate a list of references from the arXiv numbers or DOIs.

If you wish to *only* cite our code, we still ask you to cite [[arXiv:2101.08789]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08789) and link to this Github repo.
Suffice to say that, sadly, paper citations are still viewed as more important than code citations.

Depending on what parts of the code or repository you use, more works have to be acknowledged.
We re-distribute adjusted solar models and opacity tables, detailed below.
We also include (with permission) a modified version of code by Alex Geringer-Sameth.
These routines to to compute spherically symmetric functions over a grid of square pixels are contained in `python/grid_integrator/grid_integrator.py` and are excluded from the license.
You must not re-distribute these routines without contacting us until this notice is removed!

## Troubleshooting
Note that some fixes require running `make clean` or deleting the contents of your `build/` directory in order to take effect/be recognised by the CMAKE system.
* "I get some compiler related error." Try specifying the compiler that you want to use via `cmake -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=[compiler executable name or path] ..`
* "CMAKE can't find the GSL library." You can give CMAKE a hint of where to find the desired version of the GSL library via `GSL_ROOT_DIR=[path to GSL folder] cmake ..`
* "I get some pybind11 error during CMAKE." Usually, there are multiple Python versions installed (by the system, package managers, virtual environments, ...), which are likely to be the root of the problem. Check that CMAKE recognises the desired Python version that you want to use. You man need to install `cython` via `pip`. The Python frontend can be disable via `cmake -D PYTHON_SUPPORT=OFF ..`.
* "I managed to build the Python library, but I can't run the test." The name of the library in the `lib/` folder (e.g. `pyaxionflux.cpython-38-darwin.so`) which indicates the Python version used to build it (in this case: Python 3.8). This might help to identify the appropriate Python executable on your system. Some environment managers may alter/obscure environment variables like `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH` and the import may fail. Check this via e.g. `echo ${PATH}` etc. or make sure that you are in the same folder as `pyaxionflux.cpython-38-darwin.so` or a soft link to it.
